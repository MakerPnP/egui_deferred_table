# egui_deferred_table

Another egui table system, for [comparisons](#comparisons) to other popular egui crates, see below.

Why? Existing crates either don't have all the features and/or do not perform well and/or have sub-optimal APIs for creating desktop-focussed productivity-style applications.

## API

Attention is paid to defining topics of code, as below.  For most UI apps there are three distinct topics, as follows.

* [Data sources](#Data-sources) - Where the data comes from, how much of it there is, etc.
* [Actions](#Actions) - User interactions. Selection, visibility, row/column re-sizing, hiding, etc.
* [Rendering](#Rendering) - How to display the data, formatting, colors, etc.

### Data sources

egui_deferred_table has the concept of a data-source which is used to manage data retrieval, and there are blanket implementations
for various tuples. e.g. `vec![("example", 42.0_f32, true)]`.

### Actions

When a user interacts with the table, a `vec` of `Action` is returned so that your code can handle them appropriately.

### Rendering

Rendering code is separated from data-source related code.

## Status

This crate is work-in-progress, it aims to provide a 'batteries-included' solution that works for many different sources
of table data.

| Feature                    | Status      |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Layout                     | Working     |
| Variable Row Heights       | Working     |
| Variable Column Widths     | Working     |
| Smooth scrolling           | Working     |
| Hiding/Re-ordering         | Next        |
| Column/Row re-size handles | Not-started |
| Sorting                    | Not-started |
| Filtering                  | Not-started |

## Demos

See demos folder.   

Demos include examples of data sources using spreadsheets, background-loaded, sparse data sources, `vec!` data sources.

Demos include simple and complex UIs, check out the 'docking' example which combines many of the other examples into a single demo
which uses `egui_dock` tabs and windows for each demo.

1) Works only when every cell has been rendered - no-up front checking of every cell's width height.  e.g. on the first 
   frame, the rendered cells are used to calculate the column widths, but when the user scrolls down to a wider row the column width
   will not be correct.  The *only* case where the column width is correct is when the first frame renders the widest cell, this leads
   to a bad UX.
2) requires `column` to be called at runtime for each column, conditional code in the table definition required to support variable amount of columns, must be paired
   with equal amount of calls to `header.col`, usually requiring repeating the conditional logic.
3) Only at the API level.
4) Very slow with a data set of ~1000 rows and 13 columns, text-only data built from strings, floats or enums.
5) The `RowViewer` trait in the API mixes many concerns in a 'garbage-bin' style API which attempts to do everything: presentation, copy/paste, insertion/deletion, filtering, hotkeys, events.
   This leads to you having to implement or work-around features that you do not need/use/want.  It also mixes presentation with business-logic.  e.g. your cell rendering code is
   defined in the same trait impl that also selection changes and data deletion.  No clear separation between user interactions and rendering.

* The author of this crate has evaluated and used all the above crates in large desktop-style productivity apps.
